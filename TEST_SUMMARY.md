## Key Test Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Response Format Issues
- **Auth API**: Uses cookie-based sessions, not bearer tokens
- **Messages API**: Returns `data` array directly, not `data.messages`
- **Membership API**: Fixed field mapping for enhanced schema
- **Cart API**: Uses PATCH method for updates, handles existing items

### 2. Enhanced Schema Validation
- Verified all new fields are properly created and populated
- Tested foreign key relationships work correctly
- Validated enum values and constraints
- Confirmed audit logging captures system events

### 3. Real-world Test Scenarios
- **Duplicate handling**: Email uniqueness in subscribers
- **Inventory tracking**: Product stock management
- **Session management**: Cookie-based authentication
- **Payment processing**: Multiple payment types and statuses
- **Membership tiers**: Duration-based memberships with benefits

### 4. Error Handling Coverage
- **Validation errors**: Proper Zod schema validation
- **Not found errors**: 404 responses for missing resources
- **Conflict errors**: 409 responses for duplicate data
- **Authentication errors**: 401/403 responses for unauthorized access

## Test Configuration Fixes

### Jest Configuration
- Fixed `moduleNameMapper` typo (was `moduleNameMapping`)
- Proper path mapping for `@/` imports
- Node.js test environment for API testing

### Test Environment
- All tests run against live development server
- Database seeded with comprehensive test data
- Proper cleanup and connection management

## Coverage Statistics

- **Total Test Suites**: 9 (8 API + 1 Database)
- **Total Tests**: 44 (34 API + 10 Database)
- **Pass Rate**: 100% ✅
- **API Endpoints Covered**: 8 major systems
- **Database Tables Tested**: 12+ enhanced tables
