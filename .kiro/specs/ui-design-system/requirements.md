# UI Design System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a consistent UI design system across the application, removing emojis and establishing professional design patterns with a cohesive color palette.

### Requirement 1: Remove Emojis and Implement Professional Icons

**User Story:** As a user, I want a professional interface without emojis so that the application appears more business-appropriate and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN no emojis should be visible in the rendered content
2. WHEN viewing code comments or console logs THEN emojis should be replaced with simple text indicators (✓ for success, ✗ for error)
3. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN Lucide React icons should be used instead of emojis
4. WHEN viewing status messages THEN professional text should replace emoji-based feedback

### Requirement 2: Implement Consistent Color Palette

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cohesive visual experience so that the interface feels unified and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the color palette should use the specified space_cadet, ultra_violet, rose_quartz, pale_dogwood, and isabelline colors
2. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN they should follow consistent color schemes based on their purpose
3. WHEN viewing different sections THEN the color usage should be consistent across all components
4. WHEN switching between admin and public views THEN the color scheme should remain consistent

### Requirement 3: Create Reusable UI Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized UI components so that the interface is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating forms THEN standardized Input components should be available
2. WHEN displaying actions THEN standardized Button components with variants should be used
3. WHEN showing status THEN standardized Badge components should indicate different states
4. WHEN displaying content THEN standardized Card components should provide consistent layouts
5. WHEN showing loading states THEN standardized LoadingSpinner components should be used

### Requirement 4: Implement Design System Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear design system guidelines so that I can maintain consistency when adding new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new components THEN design system guidelines should be available
2. WHEN using colors THEN a clear color palette reference should exist
3. WHEN implementing typography THEN consistent font sizes and weights should be defined
4. WHEN creating layouts THEN spacing and sizing standards should be documented

### Requirement 5: Update Existing Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing components to follow the new design system so that the experience is consistent throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any existing page THEN it should use the new design system components
2. WHEN interacting with forms THEN they should use standardized input components
3. WHEN viewing navigation THEN it should follow the new design patterns
4. WHEN using admin features THEN they should maintain consistency with public features
