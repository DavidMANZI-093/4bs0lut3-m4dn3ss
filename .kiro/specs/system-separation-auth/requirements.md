# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current unified basketball platform into a properly separated multi-system architecture with role-based access control. Each system (Scoreboard, Ticketing, E-commerce, Subscriptions, Chat) will have dedicated public-facing routes for end users and protected administrative routes for system management. Additionally, a comprehensive developer status dashboard will provide system-wide monitoring and control capabilities.
