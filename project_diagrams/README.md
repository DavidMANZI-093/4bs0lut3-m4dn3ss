## Backend Principles Demonstrated

### üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Patterns**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clear domain separation with rich business logic
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing with message queues
- **Microservices Principles**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **CQRS Pattern**: Command and Query Responsibility Segregation where applicable

### üîê **Security & Compliance**
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: PCI DSS compliance considerations for payment processing
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking across all systems
- **Input Validation**: Multi-layered validation at API and business logic levels

### üöÄ **Performance & Scalability**
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis implementation for sessions, carts, and frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling with traffic distribution
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for static assets

### üí∞ **Financial Integrity**
- **Payment Processing**: Secure integration with multiple payment gateways
- **Transaction Management**: ACID compliance with proper rollback mechanisms
- **Financial Reporting**: Comprehensive transaction tracking and reporting
- **Fraud Prevention**: Multi-layered security checks and validation

### üìä **Data Management**
- **Database Design**: Normalized PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships
- **Data Consistency**: ACID transactions with proper constraint enforcement
- **Backup & Recovery**: Comprehensive data protection strategies
- **Migration Management**: Prisma-based schema versioning

### üîÑ **Real-time Capabilities**
- **WebSocket Integration**: Bi-directional real-time communication
- **Event Broadcasting**: Live updates across multiple client connections
- **Presence Management**: User activity tracking and status updates
- **Push Notifications**: Mobile and web notification delivery

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and data caching
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Payment**: Stripe, PayPal, and other gateway integrations
- **Media**: YouTube API and CDN services
- **Email**: SendGrid/SES for transactional emails
- **Background Jobs**: Queue-based async processing
- **Authentication**: JWT with secure session management

## Diagram Usage

Each diagram is written in Mermaid syntax and can be:

1. **Viewed directly on GitHub** (native Mermaid support)
2. **Rendered in IDEs** with Mermaid extensions
3. **Exported to images** using Mermaid CLI or online editors
4. **Included in documentation** for technical specifications

## Integration Points

All five systems are designed to work together as a cohesive platform:

- **Shared Authentication**: Unified user management across all systems
- **Cross-system Payments**: Centralized payment processing for tickets, memberships, and products
- **Unified Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting across all business domains
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common caching, job processing, and notification systems

## Getting Started

To understand the implementation details:

1. Review the individual diagram files for system-specific architecture
2. Examine the actual codebase in `/src/app/api/` for API implementations
3. Check `/prisma/schema.prisma` for complete data model relationships
4. See `/__tests__/` for comprehensive test coverage validation
